Contributing
============

The easiest ways to contribute are:

  * Creating a new [issue].
  * Forking the repository, make your contribution and submit a pull request.
    See [Git Flow](#git-flow) for further information.

Git Flow
--------

We use the [Git flow branching model][flow], so you are kindly required to
follow the same model when making your contributions.  That basically means
that:

  * If you are fixing a bug, you can create a *hotfix* branch from the affected
  release (preferably, the latest one) and send a pull request from that branch.

  * If you are creating a new feature, please checkout the `develop` branch and
  send a pull request from there.

  * We won't consider pull request coming from the `master` branch and if we do,
    we won't be quick.
